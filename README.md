# Capstone-Project-Deep-Learning

## Summarization:
I'll use the HuggingFace's transformers library to fine-tune a pretrained summarization module which summarize texts in Spanish using the fine-tuned multilanguage mT5 encoder/decorder architecture.

## Neural Machine Translation:

I’ll use the HuggingFace’s transformers library to fine-tune a pretrained NMT module which translates texts from Spanish to English using the multilanguage mT5 encoder/decorder architechture.

##Flask End-to-End Deep learning APP: Front-end and Back-end using the pretrained models and deployed with Flask
